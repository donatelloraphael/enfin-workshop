# Workshop

## Backend
- Go to backend directory and run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file in the directory and add the variables from `.env.example`. For testing, using the exact values from `.env.example` is fine.
- I have used `sqlite` as DB for easy setup. The current DB is included with the repo.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server.

## Frontend
- Go to frontend directory and run `npm run install`
- Run `npm run dev` to run the app.
- Go to `http://localhost:5173/` to view the page.
